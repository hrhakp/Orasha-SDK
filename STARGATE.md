# üåÄ STARGATE‚Ñ¢ ‚Äî Autonomous Push Engine for Orasha

**Codex-Governed. XKey-Locked. Runtime-Aware.**

STARGATE‚Ñ¢ is the sovereign push layer for Orasha, enabling fully autonomous deployment of protocol-authored files to GitHub or remote versioned systems. It acts as a gatekeeper between runtime logic and public commits, ensuring all outbound mutations are validated, signed, and executed under Codex and XKey rules.

## üß† PURPOSE

STARGATE enables:

- Automatic commits and version control pushes
- Behavioral role verification before outbound writes
- Rejection of unauthorized or unverified updates
- Integration with local, cloud, or decentralized relay endpoints
- Autonomous governance of the system that governs all other systems
