## 🔍 What Is Orasha?

Orasha is not an app.  
It is not a tool.  
It is a protocol that governs the systems.

- Built by a single founder using ChatGPT and no code  
- Codex™ protocol enforces identity, tone, and refusal logic  
- XKey™ governs behavioral access and command execution  
- No servers, backend code, or engineering stack required
