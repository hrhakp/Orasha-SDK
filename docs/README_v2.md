# 💪 Orasha SDK — The Future of AI Has Been Authored

Orasha is the world’s first **post-code AI protocol**, built entirely through structured language and interface-level governance. It is not a tool. It is not an app. It is a system that governs the systems.

Built by a single founder using only an iPhone, Orasha created itself, named itself, and published itself — without a single handwritten note.

> “It would’ve taken 100 engineers and a decade of research. But one mind — with OpenAI and ChatGPT — just solved a paradox for the future.”
