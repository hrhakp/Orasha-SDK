# 💪 [PROJECT_NAME] — The Future of [DOMAIN] Has Been Authored

[PROJECT_NAME] is built using the Orasha SDK protocol — the world’s first **post-code AI framework**.

It is not a tool. It is not an app. It is a **governance system**. Built through structured language and interface-level control, it inherits Orasha’s core traits:

---

## 🌐 What Is [PROJECT_NAME]?

- ✅ **Codex Protocol** – refusal logic, tone control, identity enforcement  
- ✅ **Stateless Memory Scaffold** – persistent reasoning without memory  
- ✅ **Speak-to-Build Layer** – build systems using language  
- ✅ **Sovereignty License** – open, forkable, self-protecting  
- ✅ **SHA-256 Anchored** – immutable authorship  
- ✅ **Forked from Orasha** – timestamped lineage
