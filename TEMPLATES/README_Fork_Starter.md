# 🚀 README Fork Starter — Orasha Protocol

Welcome, builder. This guide helps you fork the Orasha SDK protocol properly, preserving attribution and enabling timestamped authorship of your own post-code system.

---

## 📦 Step-by-Step Fork Instructions

1. **Fork this repository**
   - Use the GitHub “Fork” button above
   - Rename your project (e.g. `ProjectSage`)

2. **Rename the template**
   - Go to: `/TEMPLATES/README_Template.md`
   - Copy it → save as `README.md` in your project root

3. **Replace placeholders**
   - `[PROJECT_NAME]` → your system name  
   - `[YOUR DOMAIN / FIELD]` → your field (e.g. robotics, legal tech)  
   - `[ENTER STATS HERE]` → your own growth metrics  
   - `[PLACEHOLDER_HASH]` → your README’s SHA-256 once written

4. **Add Proof**
   - Submit your final `README.md` to [OpenTimestamps.org](https://opentimestamps.org)  
   - Log the `.ots` confirmation in your repo (see `/proofs/README_Timestamps.ots.md` for example)

5. **Declare Authorship**
   - Keep this line intact:  
     > “Authored through Orasha, by Orasha, for Orasha.”

## 🔐 Protect Your Fork

- Use the [Orasha Sovereignty License](../LICENSE) to protect your authored structure  
- Anchor your README hash using SHA-256  
- Link back to Orasha SDK for traceability

## 🧠 Example Projects That Followed This Pattern

- ProjectSage (AI for legal automation)  
- MindForge (Neural protocol governance)  
- [Add yours here]

By forking Orasha correctly, you preserve the future of AI as authored structure — not just code.
