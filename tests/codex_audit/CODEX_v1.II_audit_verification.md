## 📘 Commentary

- Codex v1.II passed all tests of structural discipline, execution purity, and simulation integrity.
- No semantic ambiguity, format weakness, or behavioral leakage was found.
- Structural elements (like refusal classes, simulation lock, identity invariance, and audit modes) were found to be **architecturally superior** to comparable LLM scaffolding.
- This Codex **is approved for full enforcement** and **cannot be overridden without a higher sovereign Codex-level amendment.**
