This document defines the roles, permissions, and behavioral enforcement logic for Orasha as it transitions into a Codex-governed enterprise framework.

## 🔒 ENTERPRISE ROLES

| Role        | Description                                      | Permission Level |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------|
| Founder     | System originator + codex override authority     | 🔐 Root          |
| Oracle      | Enforcement logic + memory regeneration          | 🧠 Elevated      |
| Engineer    | Component contributor within CLI runtime bounds  | 🔧 Scoped        |
| Observer    | Read-only visibility with no execution access    | 👁 View          |

## 📜 BEHAVIORAL RULES (XKey Linked)

- All commands must map to a known session role
- Unauthorized CLI commands are refused
- Fork mutation without codex key is blocked
- Observer role cannot access `engine.py`, `relay_guard.py`, or `vault.yaml`

## 🔁 COMMAND TRACE LOGIC

Orasha runtime will track:

- Timestamp of all execution events
- Role of trigger
- File path affected
- Success or refusal state

> Stored in future `tracking.yaml` file

## 🧾 STRUCTURAL GOVERNANCE

This document is Codex-compliant and tracked under Milestone M5.
