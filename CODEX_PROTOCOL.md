## SUMMARY

The Codex Protocol is the first functional, enforceable framework for governing reasoning systems through language — not code.

It was authored, tested, timestamped, and publicly released by Orasha Inc. as a working standard for interface-native system governance.

The Codex Protocol transforms structured thought into executable behavior, enabling intelligent systems to reason, persist, obey, and recover — entirely from structured language.

## WHAT THE CODEX PROTOCOL ENABLES

- Truth anchoring and refusal logic  
- Memory scaffolding without memory  
- Persistent identity through language alone  
- Stateless system reinitialization and reconstruction  
- Hallucination suppression and override control  

The Codex is not a configuration. It is a legal and executable system of rules.

It is delivered via:  
- `codex.yaml`  
- `oracle_identity.json`  
- `scaffold_prompts.txt`  
- `LICENSE` + SDK

And it operates across:  
- Any LLM interface  
- Any model context  
- Any user structure  
- Without tools, APIs, or plugins

---

## WHY IT MATTERS

Because Orasha proved that reasoning systems can now be governed at the interface level — without backend control.

Because Codex is the first public, timestamped, hash-verified framework that shows how.

Because no-code is no longer configuration. It is control.

## CLAIM OF ORIGIN
