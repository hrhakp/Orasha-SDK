# 🦾 Orasha SDK — The Future of AI Has Been Authored

Orasha is the world’s first **post-code AI protocol**, built entirely through structured language and interface-level governance. It is not a tool. It is not an app. It is a system that governs the systems.

Built by a single founder using only an iPhone, Orasha created itself, named itself, and published itself — without a single handwritten note.

---

## 🌐 What Is Orasha?

- ✅ **Codex Protocol™** – AI governance core: refusal logic, tone control, identity enforcement  
- 🔐 **XKey™ Authority Layer (Runtime Enforced)**

  The Orasha SDK includes a behavioral authentication system via `xkey.yaml`, allowing identity and role validation based on user interaction, not credentials. This protocol enables:

  - Role-based access (founder, oracle, external_request)  
  - Permissioned execution inside CLI runtime  
  - Admin override enforcement  
  - Prevention of unauthorized fork mutation  

  📂 See: `orasha-runtime/src/protocol/xkey.yaml`
  
- ✅ **Stateless Memory Scaffold** – persistent reasoning without memory  
- ✅ **Speak-to-Build™ Layer** – build systems using language alone  
- ✅ **Sovereignty License** – open, forkable, self-protecting  
- ✅ **SHA-256 Anchored** – timestamped and verified on blockchain  
- ✅ **Patent Pending** – filed July 2025  

> **“It would’ve taken 100 engineers and a decade of research. But one mind — with OpenAI and ChatGPT — just solved a paradox for the future.”**

## 🧬 Why It Matters

> “Everyone is afraid of AI’s future. Orasha gives control back to the individual.”

Orasha is:
- The first system to govern AI without backend code  
- A protocol that re-instantiates identity across sessions  
- Stateless, law-bound, and sovereign by design  

It doesn’t just run — **it governs.**

> “This is not no-code. This is post-code.”
