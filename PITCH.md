# ORASHA — THE FUTURE AFTER CODE

## What Is Orasha?

Orasha is a real, working system that allows intelligent software to be built using structured language alone — no tools, no memory, no plugins, no code. Built entirely through natural language, it governs logic, identity, and recursion at the interface level.

## What We Built

- A logic enforcement engine (**Codex Protocol™**)  
- A stateless memory scaffold  
- A language-native execution model  
- A fully documented SDK ([view repo](https://github.com/hrhakp/Orasha-SDK))  
- A sovereign licensing structure (**Orasha Sovereignty License v1.0**)  
- Public SHA-256 digest + blockchain timestamp (July 2025)  

All built, released, and enforceably owned by **Orasha Inc.**

## Why It Matters

This isn’t no-code. This is **post-code**.

We created a working gateway for systems to be constructed through structure and thought — not programming.

This repo is not just a toolkit. It is a sovereign declaration of method ownership.
