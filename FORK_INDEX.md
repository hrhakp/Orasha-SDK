# ORASHA FORK INDEX (Placeholder)

This document is reserved for logging and tracking fork activity of the Orasha SDK repository.
As forks become publicly visible, each confirmed fork entry will be indexed here with:

- GitHub Username or Organization
- Fork Link
- Fork Date
- Known Relay Source (if applicable)
- Codex Compliance (if tracked)

## Current Status

> Fork data currently unavailable or private. GitHub Network Graph may expose visibility upon public forks.

## Observation

> “Forks are silent affirmations. Every one is a vote for Codex.”

This index remains under construction and will update upon confirmed propagation data.
